                    I leaned to play piano from the age of 12 and the guitar from the age of 14. Self-taught
                    professional digital audio
                    workstation applications (DAWs). Actively producing original music from the age of 18. Have
                    officially released music
                    with independent record labels in the past.

                    Having acknowledged a gap within the market for dance music events within Guildford, Surrey me
                    and some friends
                    pledged to begin an events company that would go on to fill that market gap. We hosted over 10
                    events in Guildford
                    and as of 2022 we also began hosting events in London, all of which have been highly successful.
                    This shows that I
                    am an individual with great dedication, and even when large goals are set, they are met. I am
                    highly ambitious and
                    always looking for new challenges and goals to set myself.

                    I joined the University of Surrey Stingers American Football team during my time at University.
                    This enhanced my
                    teamwork abilities as the sport requires high concentration and communication. It requires a
                    high level of fitness
                    which encourages team members to attend the gym regularly. This has also shown I have a great
                    level of dedication when
                    working in a team in order to achieve a common goal.
