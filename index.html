              I undertook an intensive week of process operations management as part of group of a few
              individuals.

              We were required to determine the efficiency of a process filter and correlate it with
              pressure drop.
            </li>
            <li>
              Ultimately our results were consistent with the expectations (i.e., the efficiency of a
              process filter
              increases with an increase in pressure drop across the filter).
            </li>

              I gained valuable on-site experience within a chemical plant, experience within a control
              room and
              further enhanced my communication, teamwork and leadership skills.

          Having acknowledged a gap within the market for dance music events within Guildford, Surrey me
          and some friends
          pledged to begin an events company that would go on to fill that market gap. We hosted over 10
          events in Guildford
          and as of 2022 we also began hosting events in London, all of which have been highly successful.
          This shows that I
          am an individual with great dedication, and even when large goals are set, they are met. I am
          highly ambitious and
          always looking for new challenges and goals to set myself.

          Surrey Stingers American Football (September 2016 – January 2019)

          I joined the University of Surrey Stingers American Football team during my time at University.
          This enhanced my
          teamwork abilities as the sport requires high concentration and communication. It requires a
          high level of fitness
          which encourages team members to attend the gym regularly. This has also shown I have a great
          level of dedication when
          working in a team in order to achieve a common goal.
